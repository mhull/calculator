# JavaScript Calculator

This is an attempt at a JavaScript calculator that was inspired by working with a high school student who is interested in both Math and Computer Programming.

To run on the web or on a local server, just add the project folder to the server of your choice and navigate to the `index.html` file.

To run as a node.js server, you can run

    npm install

from the project directory, then run

    node server.js

to fire up the server and visit `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.  You can change the port number to one of your choosing in the `server.js` file.

You can stop the server by using `Ctrl + C`.
